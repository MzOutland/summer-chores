# summer-chores--JavaScript Callback Assignment.

This project simulates me doing summer chores without falling asleep.

# The project purpose is to practice callback functions.

# Items created in the project

    -JS **callback functions**
    -Using 'setTimeout()' to set task times
    -Nested callbacks which is referred to as (callback hell)

# How to run the Project

    -Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) if needed
    -Open terminal and navigate to the project folder:
        '''bash terminal
        cd path/to/summer-chores

# Content Learned

    -How to use callbacks
    -How to nest functions
    -How callback hell looks

# Version 2: Using Promises

    -This updated version uses JS Promises instead of callbacks.

# How does it work:

    -Each chore returns a Promise
    -Chores are chained together using ` .then()`
    -If angie falls asleep, the ` .catch()` stops everything and logs what happened

# New file:

    -`promiseVersion.js`

# How to run the new file:

    -```bash
    node promiseVersion.js

# Version 3: Async/Await

    -this version uses async and await instead of .then()
    -async pauses until the promise resolves or rejects
    -Try/catch is used to show when Angie falls asleep.

# File:

    -`asyncAwaitVersion.js`

# How to run the file:

    -node asyncAwaitVersion.js
